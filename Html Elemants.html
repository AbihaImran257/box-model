    <p>The solar system is a gravitationally bound system consisting of the Sun and all objects that orbit it, including<br>
    planets, moons, asteroids, and comets.

   <strong> Key Components:</strong>
   <i> The Sun: A star, a massive ball of hot gas that provides light and heat to the solar system.  </i>
   <mark> Planets: There are eight planets that orbit the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.</mark>
   <em> Moons: Natural satellites that orbit planets, for example, Earth has one moon.</em>
    Asteroids: Rocky, airless remnants left over from the early formation of the solar system, mostly found between Mars and
    Jupiter.
    Comets: Icy bodies that release gas and dust as they approach the sun.
    Dwarf Planets: Celestial bodies that orbit the sun but are not big enough to be classified as planets, such as Pluto.
    Other objects: Dust, gas, and other small bodies.</p>
<p>Our solar system consists of the Sun, eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune)
numerous moons, asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets like Pluto, all held together by the Sun's gravity.</p>

and comets, all orbiting our star. Here are some more facts about itOur solar system, a dynamic and fascinating place, comprises the Sun, eight planets, dwarf planets, moons, asteroids,
and comets, all orbiting our star. Here are some more facts about it</p>
<h3>Key Features And Facts</h3>
<strong>Planets:</strong> There are eight planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
<mark>Dwarf Planets:</mark> Five officially named dwarf planets exist: Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris.
 Hundreds of moons orbit various planets and dwarf planets.
<mark>Asteroids and Comets:</mark> The solar system also contains thousands of asteroids and comets.
<mark>Formation:</mark> The solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust.
<mark>Location:</mark> Our solar system is located in the Milky Way galaxy, a barred spiral galaxy.
<mark>Sun's Dominance:</mark> The Sun accounts for 99.8% of the mass in the entire solar system.

    <p>Planets: The solar system has eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
    Terrestrial vs. Gas Giants: The four inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) are rocky and terrestrial, while
    the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) are gas or ice giants.
    Dwarf Planets: Five officially recognized dwarf planets are Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris.
    Uranus's Tilt: Uranus spins on its side, almost like it's rolling around the sun.
    Jupiter's Great Red Spot: Jupiter has a giant storm, the Great Red Spot, which is shrinking.
